# Orbit-astronomical-theory-of-ice-ages

This repository includes a website, as well as a Jupyter notebook, which provides as teaching material for various courses. It was created for the course "Climate Systems II" 2021/2022 for the University of Bremen.

This can be found here: [www.awi.de/...](https://www.awi.de/fileadmin/user_upload/AWI/Forschung/Klimawissenschaft/Dynamik_des_Palaeoklimas/orbit-astronomical-theory-of-ice-ages/) and <a href="https://b-schwertfeger.de/projects/awi-work/orbit-astronomical-theory-of-ice-ages/" target="_blank" >here</a> in case the first link does not work anymore.
